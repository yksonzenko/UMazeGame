# UMazeGame
***
Pac-Man has already celebrated his 40th Anniversary.\
It is an action maze chase video game.
While going through the maze, you are trying to avoid those tricky ghosts, 
eat all of the dots to advance to the next level and eat bonus items for bonus points.\
To sum up, I want you to delve into the atmosphere of one of the best arcade games and enjoy my trial version of it!
